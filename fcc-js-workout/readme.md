# Workedout of FreeCodeCamp Algorithmic scripting

This folder contains some of my solutions of the freecodecamp's basic & intermediate level javascript coding challenges. You can view all of my worked out codes from here: https://instrumaniak.github.io/blog/javascript-workout/

In most cases, the difference between these codes from my blog's is that these can be evaluated just by running using node.js as it contains some basic tests inside the files which give some output.
